# `gitspork` Documentation

This project is still in early dev stages. We'll continue to build out more detailed documentation (and the other stuff, too) as we move forward, assuming this all actually proves useful.

## TODO

* generate .gitspork docs from struct comments
* enforce .gitspork config version vs binary version
* docs, examples buildout
* tests
