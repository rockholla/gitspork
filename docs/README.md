# `gitspork` Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> Gitspork is still in a relatively early development phase. Pre-1.0 release, we will continue to iterate here and dial in both functionality and documentation alike.

## For Upstream Developers

[comment]: <> (TODO: use generated .gitspork.yml schema docs here)
More coming soon, if you want to refer to what you can set in `.gitspork.yml` prior to better schema docs being published here, please refer to the [related golang structs](../internal/gitspork.go).

## For Downstream Integrators

More coming soon, see the [root README.md](../README.md) in the meantime for the info currently available.
